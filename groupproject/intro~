What is computer security?

- The ability for one to restrict the unauthorized spread of data'
- To patch and fix bugs wheather in kernel or software.
- To maintain protocols (disposing hardware, exe files, users access)
- To create backups, always making sure least data is lost
- Minimal downtime due to server checks
- Monitor Network activity to check any anomylies in connected addresses.
- Encryption is a major part of their jobs
- Gather data for analysists or analyse data themselves

What is encryption?

- 

Restiction of data, to only allow authorized individuals to access.

Backdoors - A way of allowing authorized individuals to access specific data, but has been
	    exploited by other individuals

DOS Attacks - Denial of service attack that will flood networks to block a user out of their network

DA Attacks- Individual is able to gain physical access to a computer on the network (installing keyloggers, worms, other viruses)

Root attack- when an attacker may SSH into your network as a guest or non admin user, but incorrect permission may allow them to sudo su

Brute force attack- When the attacker may try to join the network using dictionaries and randomly generated words (apps like crunch)

A computer Security Specialist may have to start from scratch building a firewall with special packet rules to drop or accept specific packets
minimizing the risk of an external attack. Port activity has to be monitored, to verify information being sent and recieved. Good to have obscure ports for SSH and other
network communications.
