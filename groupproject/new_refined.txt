As of 2016 there is no specific recomended post secondary plan.
According to most jobs, it is recomended to have either a degree in computer sciences/engineering or have equivialant amount of work experience.
I shall mainly focus on a computer science degree for a more condensed and less skewed presentation in terms of marks required etc.
There are numerious amount of universities accepting those trying to attain a Degree in computer science.

Some examples are: Carleton University
     	      	   Laurentian University
		   University of Toronto
		   Western University

Most Universities require a minimum average of low 70's

With courses such as:	Calculus and Vectors (U)
		  	English (U)
			Advanced Functions (U)
			With 3 other U or M courses
